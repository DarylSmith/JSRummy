The basic game strategy is to improve\n\n          one\'s hand by forming melds and eliminating deadwood. </p>\n\n      </div>\n\n\n\n      <div class="rules-melds" [hidden]="textDisplay!=\'melds\'">\n\n        <p> Gin has two types of meld: Sets of 3 or 4 cards sharing the same rank, e.g. 8♥ 8♦ 8♠; and runs of 3 or more cards\n\n          in sequence, of the same suit. e.g. 3♥ 4♥ 5♥ or more. Deadwood cards are those not in any meld. Aces are considered\n\n          low—they can form a set with other aces but only the low end of runs (A♠ 2♠ 3♠ is a legal run but Q♠ K♠ A♠ is not).\n\n          A player can form any combination of melds within their hand, whether it contains all sets, all runs, or a mix\n\n          of both. A hand can contain three or fewer melds to knock or form legal gin.</p>\n\n      </div>\n\n\n\n      <div class="rules-deadwood" [hidden]="textDisplay!=\'deadwood\'">\n\n        <p> The deadwood count is the sum of the point values of the deadwood cards—aces are scored at 1 point, face cards at\n\n          10, and others according to their numerical values. Intersecting melds are not allowed; if a player has a 3-card\n\n          set and a 3-card run sharing a common card, only one of the melds counts, and the other two cards count as deadwood.\n\n        </p>\n\n      </div>\n\n      <div class="rules-elem" [hidden]="textDisplay!=\'startgame\'">\n\n        <p>The dealer deals 10 cards to both players, and then places the next card in the deck face up. This begins the discard\n\n          pile. The face down pile is known as the stock pile. On the first turn of the round, the non-dealing player has\n\n          first option of taking the upcard on the discard pile or passing.\n\n        </p>\n\n      </div>\n\n      <div class="rules-elem" [hidden]="textDisplay!=\'gameplay\'">\n\n        <p>\n\n        On each turn, a player must draw either the (face-up) top card of the discard pile, or the (face-down) top card from the\n\n        stock pile, and discard one card from his or her hand onto the discard pile. Players alternate taking turns until\n\n        one player ends the round by knocking, going Gin, or until only two cards remain in the stock pile, in which case\n\n        the round ends in a draw and no points are awarded.\n\n        <br/>The game ends when a player reaches 100 or more points\n\n        </p>\n\n      </div>\n\n      <div class="rules-elem" [hidden]="textDisplay!=\'knocking\'">\n\n        <p> A player with 10 or fewer points of deadwood may knock, by clicking on the knock button. The cards will then be evaluated\n\n          and scored.\n\n        </p>\n\n      </div>\n\n      <div class="rules-elem" [hidden]="textDisplay!=\'gin\'">\n\n        <p> If all 10 cards in a player\'s hand fit into melds and thereby the player has no deadwood, he or she can choose to\n\n          go Gin in which case the round ends and the player going Gin receives a Gin bonus of 25 points (or another established\n\n          amount) plus any deadwood points in the opponent\'s hand.\n\n        </p>\n\n      </div>\n\n      <div class="rules-elem" [hidden]="textDisplay!=\'scoring\'">\n\n        <p>\n\n\n\n          After a player knocks, and the lay offs are made, the knocking player receives a score equal to the difference between the\n\n          two hands. For example, if a player knocks with 8, and the defender has 10 deadwood points in his or her hand \n\n          , the knocking player receives 2 points for the hand.<br/> After going gin, a player receives\n\n          a bonus of 25 points plus the entire count of deadwood in the opponent\'s hand. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n      </div>\n\n      <div class="rules-elem" [hidden]="textDisplay!=\'undercutting\'">\n\n        <p> An undercut occurs when the defending player has a deadwood count lower than or equal to that of the knocking player.\n\n       In this case, the defender scores an undercut\n\n          bonus of 25 points plus the difference between the two hands</p>\n\n\n\n      </div>\n\n      <div class="rules-elem" [hidden]="textDisplay!=\'layingoff\'">\n\n        <p>In some version of gin, players can lay off their cards by putting it the other players meld after gameplay. However,\n\n          in this version, there is no layoff--all melds after a knock are considered final</p>\n\n\n\n      </div>\n\n    </div>\n\n  </div>\n\n</div>'/*ion-inline-end:"c:\inetpub\wwwroot\jrummy-ionic\src\pages\rules\rules.html"*/
