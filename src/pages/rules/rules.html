    <div class="rules-body">
      <div class="rules-elem" [hidden]="textDisplay!='objective'">
        <p>The objective in gin rummy is to score points and reach an agreed number of points or more, usually 100, before the
          opponent does. The basic game strategy is to improve one's hand by forming melds and eliminating deadwood. </p>
      </div>

      <div class="rules-melds" [hidden]="textDisplay!='melds'">
        <p> Gin has two types of meld: Sets of 3 or 4 cards sharing the same rank, e.g. 8♥ 8♦ 8♠; and runs of 3 or more cards
          in sequence, of the same suit. e.g. 3♥ 4♥ 5♥ or more. Deadwood cards are those not in any meld. Aces are considered
          low—they can form a set with other aces but only the low end of runs (A♠ 2♠ 3♠ is a legal run but Q♠ K♠ A♠ is not).
          A player can form any combination of melds within their hand, whether it contains all sets, all runs, or a mix
          of both. A hand can contain three or fewer melds to knock or form legal gin.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="rules-deadwood" [hidden]="textDisplay!='deadwood'">
        <p> The deadwood count is the sum of the point values of the deadwood cards—aces are scored at 1 point, face cards at
          10, and others according to their numerical values. Intersecting melds are not allowed; if a player has a 3-card
          set and a 3-card run sharing a common card, only one of the melds counts, and the other two cards count as deadwood.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="rules-elem" [hidden]="textDisplay!='gameplay'">
        <p>The dealer deals 10 cards to both players, and then places the next card in the deck face up. This begins the discard
          pile. The face down pile is known as the stock pile. On the first turn of the round, the non-dealing player has
          first option of taking the upcard on the discard pile or passing.On each turn, a player must draw either the (face-up)
          top card of the discard pile, or the (face-down) top card from the stock pile, and discard one card from his or
          her hand onto the discard pile. Players alternate taking turns until one player ends the round by knocking, going
          Gin, or until only two cards remain in the stock pile, in which case the round ends in a draw and no points are
          awarded.
          <br/>The game ends when a player reaches 100 or more points
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="rules-elem" [hidden]="textDisplay!='knocking'">
        <p> A player with 10 or fewer points of deadwood may knock, by clicking on the knock button. The cards will then be evaluated
          and scored.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="rules-elem" [hidden]="textDisplay!='gin'">
        <p> If all 10 cards in a player's hand fit into melds and thereby the player has no deadwood, he or she can choose to
          go Gin in which case the round ends and the player going Gin receives a Gin bonus of 25 points (or another established
          amount) plus any deadwood points in the opponent's hand
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="rules-elem" [hidden]="textDisplay!='scoring'">
        <p>

          After a player knocks, and the lay offs are made, the knocking player receives a score equal to the difference between the
          two hands. For example, if a player knocks with 8, and the defender has 10 deadwood points in his or her hand after
          laying off, the knocking player receives 2 points for the hand.<br/> After going gin, a player receives
          a bonus of 25 points plus the entire count of deadwood in the opponent's hand. There is no chance to lay off when
          a player goes gin.</p>

        
      </div>
      <div class="rules-elem" [hidden]="textDisplay!='undercutting'">
        <p> An undercut occurs when the defending player has a deadwood count lower than or equal to that of the knocking player
          (this can occur either naturally or by laying off after a knock). In this case, the defender scores an undercut
          bonus of 25 points plus the difference between the two hands</p>

      </div>
      <div class="rules-elem" [hidden]="textDisplay!='layingoff'">
        <p>In some version of gin, players can lay off their cards by putting it the other players meld after gameplay. However,
          in this version, there is no layoff--all melds after a knock are considered final</p>
